## Disclaimer

Please note that some links and resources in this playbook are in other languages than English, and some items may only be relevant to Switzerland. Make sure to consult professionals for specific advice on your project and company. There are some great - free - agencies out there that will help you, even in early stages.

This space will probably still change shape quite often. At the moment it is a more loosely tied list of links.

Most importantly: This is just my opinion. Try it out, find what helps you. The secret of getting ahead is getting started.
